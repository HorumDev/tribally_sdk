## Configure TriballyView

Creating user and holding his unique uid on your side! So init TriballyView already with user UID and NAME.

```dart
TriballyView(
onTriballyCreated: (TriballyController controller) {
  //here you can set user credentials + project keys
  controller.setConfiguration(
    displayName: 'user name',
    uid: 'user token to identify',
    apiProject: ApiProject(
    id: 'projectId',
    api: 'apiKey');
    
}
)
```
To change user in the Tribally view call [setConfiguration] again with new data

//background color
final Color? background;

//surface color(post backgrounds)
final Color? surface;

//onSurface color(poll backgrounds)
final Color? onSurface;

//text color
final Color? text;
